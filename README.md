# TP-Covid-Hospitals-using-R
Final Project of Operations Research course @UBA as part of my Engineering degree

You may find attached the final document (), the R language code used () and de csv. files () necessary to run it.

The main objective of this project was to optimize the hospoitals resources as to assist the best number of patients and identify when the intensive care unit beds will be at 100% occupancy considering the forecasted demand.

The SIMPLEX method learnt during the Operations Reasearch course was used to optimize this problem. The main variables was the demand of three group of patients (Regular, COVID and intense care), while the variables that conditioned the problem where #beds, #doctors and #medical_kits.
